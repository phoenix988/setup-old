# Setup - Utility that will configure my desktop

Utility that will configure your desktop using my configuration files

My plan is to make this work on any distro but currently its just in testing phase and isn't that stable, But this script will work best on arch for now

# OBS This project is work in progress use on your own risk (I recommendnd to not use it at all not working right now!!!)
## Currently testing on 

Arch 

Ubuntu

Debian

Fedora

This script includes the following
All config files will be pulled from my dotfiles repository

PcManFM - Graphical FileManager

OH-MY-ZSH - Plugin Manager for ZSH

Fish,Zsh and Bash - you get to choose the Default

Starship - Crossplatform Shell Prompt

Choose between firefox,qutebrowser,chromium or brave as your browser

Grub Theme (Only have it tested and working on Debian and Arch)

BTOP - Terminal System Resource Monitor

Docker - Container Virtulization 

OBS this script also deactivates root password prompt when using sudo this will be a security risk I just prefer it because I'm lazy

Some of these Programs are optional and the script will prompt you if you want to install it or not. 

## This script installs some GTK themes which includes

Dracula

## Information for Arch Users

If you need to install a fresh version of arch linux this script can do it for you automatically.
All you need to do is to answer a few prompt for example which disk you want to use for the installation.
The script will detect that you use the archiso so you can just run the same script

1. wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phoenix988/setup/main/config.sh
2. bash config.sh
3. Reboot
4. Now you can customize your new installation by hand or clone this repo and run this script again.

## Important Info!!!

This repo is mainly for me to make it easier for me when I reinstall

The run.sh script is broken it doesnt work, I also wanted to be able to run this script on a remote machine but at the moment that doesnt work

This is in Beta I recommend to not use this on a production machine use it in  VM or Testing Machine

## In order to use this script follow these steps

1. git clone https://github.com/phoenix988/setup.git 
2. cd setup
3. ./config.sh


And lastly just follow the prompts this script will ask you some questions before it run
