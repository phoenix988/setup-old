This is a work in progress 

But the point of this repository is so that it will be faster for me when I install a new system

In order to use this script follow these steps



1 If you want to run this on a remote machine you need to run run.sh and then type the 
ip address

2 If you ran this on a remote machine it will execute config.sh on that remote machine and 
install all my config files etc. 

3 But if you run this script on your local machine you only need to run config.sh
